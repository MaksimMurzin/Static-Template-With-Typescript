this is a template project with typescript instead of javascript

if you are making changes to typescript you will need to recompile using: 
    `npx tsc --watch`

now that everything is packaged with vite you can use:
` npm run dev ` 
to run the project

## Running Vite 
- locally run: 
`npx vite`

- for production: 
`npx vite build`

### Issues encountered:

- Index.html problem
I was using Vite to package everything, the problem was that my project has two index.html files,
one that I made and one that was generated by Vite, 
for whatever reason Github Actions was ignoring the one generated by vite, which has all my css and js bundled
and instead would use the one in the root folder, this meant that I had no assets available on my page. 
The solution was to go into Settings>Pages and select gh-pages as the build folder, not main.

- using npx serve 
when testing locally I was using `npx serve dist` to launch my web page locally,
but this does not respect Vites base folder, hence I had no access to my assets, 
the solution here is to use `npm run preview` which mimics what the Github-actions would use
